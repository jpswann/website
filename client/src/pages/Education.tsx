            At Columbia University in New York (January 2013 â€“ May 2017), I
            earned a Bachelor of Arts in Earth Science with a Minor in Computer
            Science. My studies included advanced programming, data structures,
            Big Data with Python, and courses in computer science and Java,
            along with the fundamentals of computer systems. This diverse
            academic background provided me with a strong interdisciplinary
            foundation in analytical thinking and technical problem-solving,
            skills that continue to drive my work today.
